# Virtual Host Using Alexa

Virtual Host Using Alexa is a project developed for our annual university fest, aimed at enhancing the event experience by introducing an interactive virtual host powered by Alexa AI. This virtual host interacts live with the real human host, making the events more engaging and fun. It is designed to be adaptable for any type of event, providing a seamless experience for both organizers and attendees.

## Features

- **Interactive Experience:** The virtual host interacts with the audience in real-time, responding to queries and commands using Alexa AI.
- **Customizable Responses:** Intents are created to understand various queries and commands related to the event, ensuring a personalized experience for users.
- **Multimodal Support:** Images are incorporated into the interaction to complement Alexa's speech and enhance engagement.
- **Live Image Capture:** Firebase is used to capture images live during the event, providing visual feedback to complement the virtual host's responses.
- **Flexible Configuration:** The project is built using Python, Node.js, and Raspberry Pi, offering flexibility and scalability for future enhancements and modifications.
